# App Icons

To generate new icons, delete the old ones and go here: [http://www.favicon-generator.org/](http://www.favicon-generator.org/) or your favorite tool.

> Note: If you're using this boilerplate in conjunction with Taco Util classes, just add `<?php echo Theme::appIcons(); ?>` to `header.php` to use these icons automatically.
